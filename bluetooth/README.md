# Update WIFI parameters using browser

1. hard reset SKY2 (hold wifi button for 10 seconds) -- this enables Bluetooth and starts advertising BSKY
2. open index.html in Chrome
3. click on Connect -- BSKY should appear
4. once paired Device ID and current status should appear

Warning: If your status is not 1 -- you are unlikely to succeed in updating WIFI parameters.

5. Fill out your WIFI SSID and Password (2.4 GHz network only) 
6. click on Update WIFI
7. refresh Device Status -- within 10 seconds it should go to 3 -- meaning connected and pinged gateway
8. if the status changed to 5 - it was unsuccessful in connecting to the WIFI network

Once successful restart your gateway (push a power button) -- hopefully you are now set.
